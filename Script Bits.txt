Script Bits

*Lyn you have done a great job of the story board and related scripts these will hopefully fill in the gaps*

Intro

Too many lives have been lost on Australian roads, 30% of these are due to speed related accidents. Why don’t we do more to reduce this number? 
Here at ColourTech we are designing a speed limiting device that is relative to the road the car to keep you, your loved ones and friends safer on the road.  

“Scene of Speeding Car Crashing” 

Too many times do scenes like these appear on the news, social media and sometimes right in front of our eyes.

“Picture of cemetery” 

Why risk it all for the need to get someone a tiny bit faster? Don’t make your family have to go through this for you or another innocent driver’s family go through this for a foolish decision.
